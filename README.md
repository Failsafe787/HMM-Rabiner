# HMM-Rabiner
A Java implementation of the Baum-Welch algorithm based on HMM models with multiple and continuous observations, presented in L. R. Rabiner's paper "A Tutorial on Hidden Markov Models". All the erratas are integrated in this project.

## About this project
This is a university project I'm developing for an exam. Many parts are or can be incorrect (including the formula, code and tests) or missing and are subjected to changes without any notice due to the fact I'm learning how to work with HMMs and classifiers while actively working on it.

## State

### Current version

0.1.15 (02/04/2018) (Public build) **Deprecated** 

*Current code is garbage due to lots of flaws caused by a bad application design*

0.X.01 (04/12/2018) (Private build)

*A new version is currently under heavy development, featuring better application design, multimodel classifiers, Swing GUI and other stuff*
