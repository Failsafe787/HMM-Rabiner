# HMM-Rabiner
An implementation of the Baum-Welch algorithm based on HMM models with multiple and continuous observations, presented in L. R. Rabiner's paper "A Tutorial on Hidden Markov Models". All the erratas are integrated in this project.

## State of this project
This is a university project I'm developing for an exam. Many parts are incorrect and are subjected to changes without any notice due to the fact I'm still learning most of the subject and I'm actively working on it.
